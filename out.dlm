Christmas and New Year celebrations happen in every corner of the world in full swing and Wales is no exception. Calennig is the Welsh equivalent of New Year’s Day and is celebrated on the first day of the new year according to the Julian calendar. The people of Cwm Gwaun have preserved old traditions and celebrate this day according to how their ancestors did in the 17th century. Till today, young boys visit each house in the village to splash the villagers with water that they retrieved from the local well. This activity is seen as a symbol of good fortune. In return, the villagers are expected to give the Calennig — a small gift, usually in the form of copper coins. Unfortunately, the history and origin of Calennig are not well known and several folklores are surrounding it. But historians believe that Calennig must have evolved from the ancient custom of giving gifts and money on New Year’s Day.  One thing we do know is that Cwm Gwaun, Pembrokeshire, is keeping this tradition alive and celebrating it on January 13 each year. However, over the years the customs have evolved differently in many areas of Wales. In some areas, the celebration takes place in the form of the chanting of a small verse or two in exchange for small coins. While in other areas, the tradition of water splashing is still at large|Federal|Cultural, Festivities, Historical
